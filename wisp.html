It is also possibly the most benign, and it has been speculated that Wisps are actually the children of the other Illusenes.</p><p>Will o' Wisps seem to spend much of their time drifting about, casting very few illusions at all.  In fact, some Wisps have been reported to actually lead travelers out of danger rather than into it.</p><p>Unfortunately, very little other information has been gathered on these small, floating globes of light.  If there are any travelers, adventureres or scholars who do have more information on this topic, please send it to the Master of the Archives at the Archivist's Keep by your preferred means.</p></div>
