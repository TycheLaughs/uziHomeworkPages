<img class="illuminated" src="./images/illum_T.png" alt="T"><p>he mwenin is a bizarre, frog-like creature with far too many eyes and a massive mouth, secretes an acidic,  flammable oil on its skin.  Having no means by which to set itself on fire, it wanders swamplands and particularly dank basements, gnawing on anything it can find. Considered a pest, mwenin are incredibly difficult to roust once they've reached infestation levels, and, because they are invulnerable to fire, are not easily disposed of.</p>
<p>Mwenin were, purportedly, an accidental creation of Arminean the Ancient, when he misplaced several magical experiments at once and they reacted. Badly.  Unfortunately for the rest of Erashuna, the story goes,  Arminean found these creatures adorable, and his swiftly-approaching senility left him blind to the wanton destruction that followd these abominations, including the loss of all of his notes pertaining to the experiments he was pursuing at the time.</p><p>
When threatened, this creature will not often flee, but instead may spit a more concentrated version of their acidic mucous-oil at foes and leap wildly about to possibly distract and confuse their attackers.  
</p>
<p>When threatened in groups, these abominations will swarm their attackers instead, covering a wide area with their oily slime, and then at least one will go in search of a nearby, malicious Wisp or Lantern Sister to set apark to it, often resulting in travelers being set aflame.
