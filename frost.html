In larger groups, Frostbites either travel with or carry with them large storms, usully accompanied by terrible winds. </p><p>Those Frostbites who do travel in blizzards do swarm any unsuspecting individual in their path, and, in many cases, freeze that poor individual to death.</p>
<p>The most common way to combat the effects of Frostbites is to simply wear warm, well-tightened clothing.  Other methods for dispersing these spirits have been to toss salt into the wind on the eve of a storm or to burn certain herbs to ward them off.</p>
