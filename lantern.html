<img class="illuminated" src="./images/illum_L.png" alt="L"><p>antern Sisters are quite possibly the worst of the illusenes, preying on travelers, merchants and those few who brave Erashuna on their own.  Rather than simply passive illusions, Lantern Sisters will band together to create dizzying and horrific illusions to drive their victims a) mad, b) over the edge of a cliff, into the teeth of some other nasty creature or c) into some other trap.  In any case, Lantern Sisters mean horrible luck for anyone who encounters them, and often times death or grievous injury.
