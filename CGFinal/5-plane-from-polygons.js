/*Write a program to calculate the plane equation coefficients, given n
vertices of a polygon. The vertices are enumerated in a counterclockwise direction.
The polygon may be planar or just approximately planar. Your program’s output
should be the plane equation (in the form of [A B C D], the plane’s normal) and a flag
indicating whether the plane is exactly or only approximately planar.*/
