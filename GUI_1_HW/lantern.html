<img class="illuminated" src="./images/illum_L.png" alt="L"><p>antern Sisters are quite possibly the worst of the illusenes, preying on travelers, merchants and those few who brave Erashuna on their own.  Rather than simply passive illusions, Lantern Sisters will band together to create dizzying and horrific illusions to drive their victims a) mad, b) over the edge of a cliff, into the teeth of some other nasty creature or c) into some other trap.  In any case, Lantern Sisters mean horrible luck for anyone who encounters them, and often times death or grievous injury. 
</p><p>Both Lantern Sisters and False Guides are somewhat common throughout both forested areas and swamps. Though Lantern Sisters tend to avoid high peaks, Fale Guides will quite often lead climbers to their doom. Likewise, Lantern Sisters are more prevalent in the southerly regions of Erashuna, while False Guides make their homes in colder climes. </p><p>It is therefore unsurprising that both Lantern Sisters and False Guides can be found in Rezin, which is by far the most varied country on Erashuna in both altitude and temperature-- as well as possibly the most inhospitable on all fronts, from climate to environment to flora and fauna.</p></div>
