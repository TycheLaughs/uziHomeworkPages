<img class="illuminated" src="./images/illum_F.png" alt="F"><p>alse Guides are another subset of Illusenes who often wreather themselves in the illusion of an actual lantern, so as to appear as if someone is helping travelers in the dark.  Often appearing just as travelers have gotten lost or into some kind of sticky predicament-- which often the False Guide has caused by leading the travelers with more subtle illusions-- the False Guide will quickly make the situation worse, usually leading the travelers to their own deaths. </p>
